     * @short Abstract class for sampling generalized linear models.
     *
     * GLMMethod provides a base class for sampling methods that work
     * on generalized linear models (GLMs).  Most of the update
     * machinery is provided by GLMMethod itself. 
     *
     * GLMMethod uses sparse matrix algebra provided by the 
     * CHOLMOD library. In the context of a hierarchical model,
     * mixed models appear identical to fixed-effect models except
     * that mixed models have a design matrix that is sparse.  The use
     * of CHOLMOD, along with auxiliary variable sampling,
     * allows us to handle both fixed and random effects in a
     * consistent way without needing to distinguish between them or
     * relying on asymptotic approximations.
