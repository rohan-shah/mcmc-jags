     * A stochastic version of the Iteratively Weighted Least Squares
     * algorithm (IWLS) was proposed by Gammerman D (1997). Efficient
     * sampling from the posterior distribution in generalized linear
     * mixed models. Statistics and Computing 7:57-68.  The algorithm
     * is a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that uses IWLS to generate a
     * proposal.
     *
     * The IWLS method is restricted to fixed effects as it relies
     * on an asymptotic approximation that does not hold for random
     * effects models.
